Wosis - a python package developed to allow interactions between WoS Client, wos_parser, and Metaknowledge

For the moment it is probably best to install by cloning the repository and:

```bash
$ python setup.py develop
```

or via `pip`

```bash
$ pip install git+https://ConnectedSystems@bitbucket.org/wosis.git@master
```
